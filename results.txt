Results
We succeeded in building a system which is highly adaptive despite being based solely on very simple rules. Running it with many different distribution functions we learned that the agents will always distribute themselves in a beneficial way. Even under very hard circumstanstances where the distribution function cuts off all agents from good soil they managed to get back on that good soil due to some random movement. Comming back to our initial question we found that the connectedness of an agent which allows him to propose trades and a certain social preference of its neighbours which will enable money and information flow are crucial for its success. To quantify these findings we've seen that GDF of 1 and WTF of 1 alongside medium connectedness leads to the best results, meaning longest survival and highest adaptivity of the agents. We conclude that in a system with these assumptions very "social" agents (social in the same spirit as described in the section on design principles) are best suited for survival. Preference for itself or for "friends" can only harm the adaptivity of the system as there is a one-to-one correspondence between the number and distribution of an agent's neighbours and this agent's adaptivity and thus its success.  

Discussion
Despite the abstract nature of this model it nevertheless allows us to draw positive, as well as normative conclusions which we will illustrate in the following.
The cause and process of migration in our model coincides on many levels with theories trying to explain migration. Two ways in which migration is understood are neoclassical economics and relative deprivation theory [Jennissen, R. "Causality Chains in the International Migration Systems Approach."]. Migration from the perspective of neoclassical economics is a problem of demand and supply: Having lower wages in one place and higher wages in another place indicates that the first one has a surplus of labour and a shortage of money while the latter is directly opposite. People moving from the regions with lower wages to the regions with higher wages are, from a neoclassical economical perspective, the logical consequence. We can observe exactly this behaviour in our model: first we check that our agents fulfill the three assumptions of neoclassical economics [E. Roy Weintraub. (2007). "Neoclassical Economics". The Concise Encyclopedia Of Economics.] Our agents have rational preferences in the form of GDF and WTF and they maximize utility; both of these assumptions have already been broadly explained in the section on design choices. Other than that our agents also decide everything on the basis of full and relevant information, this together with the flow of information in our model has also been discussed in said section. We therefore can conclude that our agents are well-suited for a neoclassical model. Running the model with a realistic distribution function we observe that some time after the random initial distribution of the agents an equilibrium is reached where agents are distributed around the areas of high prosperity; the market has reached an equilibrium.
Relative deprivation theory on the other hand explains migration from another perspective. Instead of viewing the system from a bird's eye perspective it looks at the individuals. Richard Schaefer defines relative deprivation in the following way: "the conscious experience of a negative discrepancy between legitimate expectations and present actualities." [Richard T. Schaefer, Racial and Ethnic Groups, 11th Ed.]. We can easily see that this is what happens in our model if we take a less bird's-eye-like perspective: agents learn that their neighbours fare better than themselves and thus want to improve their own position.
Our model takes overpopulation of certain areas into consideration as resources are always distributed per parcel and all agents on a parcel share the resources it yields. We found that building mechanisms into our model that allow an agent to compare its current position to the position in the last tick vastly improved the longevity of the agents as it reduces overpopulation of certain areas. In the real world we often observe the bad impacts rural flight has on the fleeing people as many find their situation actually worsened compared to before [Weeks, John (2012). Population: an introduction to concepts and issues]. One problem is that big bursts of rural flight lead to an increase in population which can not be dealt with by the existing infrastructure [Min-Harris, C. "Youth migration and poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa: Empowering the Rural Youth"]. This is very similar to the effect in our model before our amelioration. Our model therefore suggests that enabling higher mobility of migrants could lead to better results.

Most of our observations based on running the simulation and observing the behaviour. Another approach would be to actually let the agents learn the best initial configurations. This would provide better ground for answering the question of what kind of society works best in this model.
